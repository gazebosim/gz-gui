## Overview

Screenshots of the current 3D scene can be taken using the screenshot plugin.
The default directory for saved screenshots is in `~/.ignition/gui/pictures` and
the filename will be the timestamp of when the screenshot was taken.
It is possible to change the default directory to a different location, which will
be shown in the example below.

**Note**: This example is using Ignition Gazebo but is not required.
The same steps can be done using `ign gui` with a 3D scene.

First, go to the plugins menu on the top right (vertical ellipsis) then select
'Screenshot':

The default location of saved screenshots is `~/.ignition/gui/pictures`, to change
this click on the folder icon:

A file dialog menu will appear and a new save location can be selected.
Once selected, all new screenshots will be saved in the chosen directory.
